# CIL
## What is CIL?

Computer Interpreted Language (CIL) is (as the name implies) a computer programming language that uses an interpreter to execute code in a .cil file.

## Who is CIL for?

CIL is purposefully built for beginners with no prior coding experience.  While other languages such as Python are known for being beginner-friendly but still able to perform well for professional work, CIL removes all of the complex features of other high-level languages in favor of offering the most straightforward and easy-to-understand syntax to best assist newcomers to programming with understanding the primitive logic behind a computer program and how code is executed on a computer.

## Planned Implementation Timeline

This language is FAR from complete, and is missing many basic functionalities that would even qualify it as a feasible programming langauge for public use.  While the full scope of the feature set of this language is not finalized, there is a plan of what key features should be implemented, in an order which should offer the best balance between ease-of-implementation and future scalability of the language and its underlying interpreter.

### Implementation Timeline

    - Print Statement (Functional as of [01/24/2025])
    - Primitive Variable Declaration
    - Print Variable Argument Handling
    - Variable Modification
    - Conditional Branching (If-Else)
    - Looping (For/While)
    - "Main" Function
    - First-class Functions
    - CMake File

### Current Feature Implementation

## Inspirations

### Why CIL over other languages?

What makes CIL special compared to other high-level languages is not what features are supported by the language, but rather what it lacks in comparison to other languages.  The range of what you can do in this language is vastly inferior to languages like Java, Python, and C/C++, and that's by design!  This language isn't made for professional/enthusiast work; it's designed to make simple programs that can be understood by complete newcomers to coding.  

### Initial Project Idea

The idea for this project actually came from a class I took in college called "Principles of Languages", which taught us about the makings of a programming language and all the various forms a language can take.  One of our projects for this class was to come up with a made-up language and all of its features.  While some of the syntax and implementations of this language differ slightly from the original project from 2023, the core foundation of making an easy-to-read language designed for simple beginner-level programs has not changed, and in this repo is a copy of the original presentation if you're interested in seeing this project's origins.

### Interest in the Idea

The idea of this programming language was thought up several years ago, but it's only just now being implemented because of my newfound interest in compilers and interpreters in general, and I wanted to better understand how they work and how they are optimized by creating a translator for a language myself.  Something like Python is a bit too feature-complete for me since I don't have any experience making an interpreter or compiler, but that's when I found a copy of our original powerpoint presentation sitting on my computer, and it acted as a spark of motivation for me to try out, since that old project already provided me with a good idea of what kind of syntax the language would have.  This is mostly just a passion project in a pursuit to learn a new area of programming, and if it evolves into something actually usable for its theorized purpose of helping other get into coding, then that would make this project all the more enjoyable.

### Experience in CS Tutoring

Throughout my time both learning programming and tutoring other university students, I have noticed some patterns with students having a difficult time understanding basic computer science principles and program logic when learning to code, and in some instances have seen bad habits reappear in more advanced courses that have required correction.  These experiences in recognizing these patterns and correcting common mistakes have led to the founding ideas of the original "Computer" language back in 2023 having a syntax as closely related to English as possible in order to keep prospective learners from falling into bad habits and better optimizing the learning journey.

## Future README Additions

Right now the language is still in very-early stages of development and experimentation, so it doesn't make sense yet to add some sections to this README that might be expected of a more polished repository.  As the language adds support for more features and the end-goal of the project is further realized/implemented, there are a few sections that I want to add in the future.

    - Installation Instructions
    - Example Usage of Execution
    - Language Documentation
