# CIL
## What is CIL?

Computer Interpreted Language (CIL) is (as the name implies) a computer programming language that uses an interpreter to execute code in a .cil file.

## Who is CIL for?

CIL is purposefully built for beginners with no prior coding experience.  While other languages such as Python are known for being beginner-friendly but still able to perform well for professional work, CIL removes all of the complex features of other high-level languages in favor of offering the most straightforward and easy-to-understand syntax to best assist newcomers to programming with understanding the primitive logic behind a computer program and how code is executed on a computer.

## Planned Implementation Timeline

This language is FAR from complete, and is missing many basic functionalities that would even qualify it as a feasible programming langauge for public use.  While the full scope of the feature set of this language is not finalized, there is a plan of what key features should be implemented, in an order which should offer the best balance between ease-of-implementation and future scalability of the language and its underlying interpreter.

###Implementation Timeline
    Print Statement (Functional as of [01/24/2025])
    Primitive Variable Declaration
    Print Variable Argument Handling
    Variable Modification
    Conditional Branching (If-Else)
    Looping (For/While)
    "Main" Function
    First-class Functions

## Inspirations

### Why CIL over other languages?

What makes CIL special compared to other high-level languages is not what features are supported by the language, but rather what it lacks in comparison to other languages.  The range of what you can do in this language is vastly inferior to languages like Java, Python, and C/C++, and that's by design!  This language isn't made for professional/enthusiast work; it's designed to make simple programs that can be understood by complete newcomers to coding.  

### Initial Project Idea

The idea for this project actually came from a class I took in college called "Principles of Languages", which taught us about the makings of a programming language and all the various forms a language can take.  One of our projects for this class was to come up with a made-up language and all of its features.  While some of the syntax and implementations of this language differ slightly from the original project from 2023, the core foundation of making an easy-to-read language designed for simple beginner-level programs has not changed, and in this repo is a copy of the original presentation if you're interested in seeing this project's origins.

## Future README Additions

Right now the language is still in very-early stages of development and experimentation, so it doesn't make sense yet to add some sections to this README that might be expected of a more polished repository.  As the language adds support for more features and the end-goal of the project is further realized/implemented, there are a few sections that I want to add in the future.
